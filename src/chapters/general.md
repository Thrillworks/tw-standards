# 1. General Rules
The goal of this document is to signal our intent when using our craft. Like thousands of generations of artisan and craftspeople before us we all add our individual flair to what we do. We highly encourage new thinking and innovation while embracing the needs of our team mates. This document exists for the good of the many, not the few, or the one.

  1. ## Industry Standards.
  Sticking with conventions facilitates collaboration and code reuse. This guide aims to follow  the ever evolving community conventions and best practices wherever community conventions are clear and wherever community best practices are sound for our business. This guide should be amended _whenever we find that it clearly contradicts existing or emerging community conventions and best practices._
  2. ## Contribute to These Guidelines.
    These guidelines are meant to be a living document, pooling experience earned by different developers, including yourself. Please contribute.
  3. ## Educate Others.
    Best practices are a collective endeavour. It is not enough to follow them yourself. Educate others and ask for compliance.
  4. ## Use Tools.
    Use tools to enforce best practices. Use linting tools to catch some of the most common problems. Use a continuous integration server to enforce best practices in a group.
